=0.7.5.4=
  * added FabricationMediator.hasReaction method

  * if FabricationMediator.onRegister method will be overwritten without call to super.onRegister() method, warning will be raised in console.
  * registrations of internal framework actors ( like FabricationDependencyPRoxy ) are no longer shown in console actions panel.
=0.7.5.1=
  * FabricationFacade.addDependencyProviders method has been removed. Please, use IFabrication.dependencyProviders getter to return array of providers classes or instances.
  * fixed bug with logging data >40k through LocalConnection ( fabrication logging )

  * introduced [http://code.google.com/p/fabrication/wiki/FabricationRPCDependencies Fabrication RPC extension] based on custom dependencies mechanism

=0.7.4.1=
  * fixed notification action log in console

=0.7.3=
 * added separate builds for flex3 (moxie) support
 * when injecting proxy if it is not registered framework will try to create & register. This should work fine if   proxy constructor has no params or has params wit default values

=0.7.2=

=0.7.1=
 * added fabrication namespace ( http://puremvc.org/utilities/fabrication/2010 )
 * AirApplication/FlexApplication for spark and AirHaloApplication/FlexHaloApplication for halo architecture
 * Introduced FabricationModuleLoader and FabricationAirModuleLoader - simplified way to manage modules using ModuleManager
 * Introduced new Reactions registration approach
 * Introduced simply IoC for fabrication actors


=0.7=
 * Added support for Flex4 SDK
 * Rearranged repository layout
 * Introduced FlexUnit4 tests
 * Added AsyncFabricationCommand
 * Fixed ComponentResolver and reflexive mediator registration problem in spark components
 * Fixed reflexive registration problems in components with deferred child instantiation ( TabNavigator etc. )
 * New libraries:
       * included pureMVC core, pipes and async command libs into each distribution
       * separate distributions for air, flex and pure as3
       * recompiled using Flex4 SDK and AIR2 SDK official releases

=0.6=
  * Added support for Notification Interceptors.
  * Added support for automatic component Reactions.
	* Added support for multiple undo history stacks within the same application.

=0.5.3=
  * Fixed issue with resolve for components with id and name.
  * Added config object to IFabrication and concrete implementations.

=0.5=
  * Fixed memory leaks within the framework.
  * Fixed incorrect component route caching.
  * Refactored ComponentRouteMapper object to be cached at the facade level instead of globally.
  * Fixed incorrect notification caching in the FabricationMediator.
  * Refactored message routing internals to use an explicit TransportNotification instead of the earlier dynamic implementation.
