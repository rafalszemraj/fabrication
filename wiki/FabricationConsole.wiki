= Introduction =

Fabrication Console is AIR based application for debugging & developer support for fabrication based applications.

= Details =

[http://code.szemraj.eu/fabrication/console/images/preview/console.jpg]

Console is divided into three parts:

  * *Flow* console, where all important and framework-related events are logged ( actors registrations, commands executions, notification sending etc. ). By clicking small icon on the right you can display a few details about given action.
  * *Log* console, where developer can log custo messages ( filtered by levels ) and inspect objects.
  * *Error* console, where problems notification form framework are displayed.

= Flow console =

To enable flow console logging from your application you have to override *fabricationLoggerEnabled* method in your application ( module ) main class ( fabricator ):

*Example.as*
{{{
<fabrication:FlexHaloApplication
	xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml"
	xmlns:fabrication="http://puremvc.org/utilities/fabrication/2010"
	>
	<mx:Script>
		<![CDATA[

        import shell.controller.FabricationRoutingDemoShellStartupCommand;

        override public function getStartupCommand():Class  {
            return FabricationRoutingDemoShellStartupCommand;
        }
        override public function get fabricationLoggerEnabled():Boolean   {
            return true;
        }
		]]>
	</mx:Script>
</fabrication:FlexHaloApplication>
}}}

= Log console =

To use custom loggins you have to create *Logger* instance and add console channel to it:
{{{
  var logger:Logger = Log.getLogger( "myLogger" );
  logger.addChannel( FabricationLoggerChannel.getInstance() );
}}}
then, you can log messages using five levels ( wich then can be filtered in Log console ) or inspect object:
{{{
   logger.debug( "debug message" );
   logger.info( "debug message" );
   logger.warn( "debug message" );
   logger.error( "debug message" );
   logger.fault( "debug message" );

   logger.inspectObject( [ "hello", "from", "fabrication" ], "myArrayOfStrings" );
}}}
You can use *Log* class static methods for more convenient logging. To do so you have to remember to create global logger instance in first place ( logger instance without _name_ ):
{{{
  Log.getLogger().addChannel( FabricationChannel.getInstance() );
  Log.debug( "debug message" );
  Log.info( "debug message" );
  Log.warn( "debug message" );
  Log.error( "debug message" );
  Log.fault( "debug message" );
}}}

*TIP:* you can write you own channel and add it to any instance of *Logger* class. Remember that your channel has to implement *ILogChannel* interface ( http://code.google.com/p/fabrication/source/browse/framework/trunk/src/org/puremvc/as3/multicore/utilities/fabrication/logging/channel/ILogChannel.as ).

= Error console =

In here any message from fabrication about something wrong just happened is logged. At this moment these two situations are reported:
  * there is a problem resolving reaction ( typo in reactTo/trapTo methon in sourceName place, event source is null etc. )
  * notification has been sent and no observator is registered for it ( including commands and interceptors ).

*If you have any idea about more situations that could be prompted in here, let me know*
