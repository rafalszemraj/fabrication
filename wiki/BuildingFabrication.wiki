=Requirements=
Fabrication uses Ant build files to build itself. To run the build files you need [http://ant.apache.org Apache Ant] version 1.6.5+.

=Checking out the sources=
To build Fabrication you need the main frameworks branch of the repository. The checkout url is below,

{{{
http://fabrication.googlecode.com/svn/framework/trunk/
}}}

Once you have checked out the framework repository, you can build the Fabrication swcs. To do this, run the following command from the directory that you checked out the repository.

{{{
ant swc
}}}

This will create the swcs for the current version of Fabrication in the *dist* directory. To create the swc for just the flex platform use,

{{{
ant swc-flex
}}}

=Main Targets=

The main targets in the Fabrication build file are described below.

|| upgrade-examples       ||  Upgrades all examples ||
|| zip                    ||  Generates a zip file from the trunk ||

=Examples=
Most of the [http://fabrication.googlecode.com/svn/examples Fabrication example applications] can be build using ant. If you have checked out only specific examples you will need to add/modify the *fabrication.dir* property in the build.properties to the directory where Fabrication is checked out or where the Fabrication source zip was extracted. Then to build and run the application you can run the following command in the directory of the application example.

{{{
ant
