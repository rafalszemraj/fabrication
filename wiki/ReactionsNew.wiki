=Introduction=
Starting from verion 0.7.1 you can use advanced reaction registration mechanism. From now you can use:
*reactTo<ComponentName>$<EventName>* syntax ( be aware of dollar sign between component and event name ).

=Requirements=
This feature needs Fabrication version 0.7.1 or above.

=Usage Scenario=
Consider the typical anatomy of a PureMVC Mediator class for an mxml view component show below.

*MyForm.mxml*
{{{
<mx:Form>
	<mx:TextInput id="emailInput" />
	<mx:Button id="submitButton" label="Submit Button"/>
</mx:Form>
}}}

*FormMediator.as*
{{{
public class FormMediator extends FlexMediator {

	static public const NAME:String = "FormMediator";

	public function FormMediator(viewComponent:Object) {
		super(NAME, viewComponent);
	}

       /* not needed anymore
	public function get submitButton():Button {
		return viewComponent.submitButton as Button;
	}
       */

	public function onRegister():void {
		submitButton.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, submitButtonClicked);
	}

	private function submitButtonClicked(event:MouseEvent):void {
		// submit form
	}

}

}}}

Instead of subscribing to the click event you just add a click handler with the reactTo syntax.

{{{
public function reactToSubmitButton$Click(event:MouseEvent):void {
	// submit form
}
}}}

=Implementation Details=

  # To use new Registration mechanism *you don't need* to declare public getter to viewComponent child if this child is accessible outside this component. You have to remember about CamelCase naming convention.
  # You can use capture phase by declaring method as: *trap<ComponentName>$<EventName>* 
  # All others details are the same as in standard reactions ( removing, constant style event names etc. )
